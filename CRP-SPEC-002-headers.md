---

## Abstract

This document defines the complete vocabulary of HTTP header fields for the Context Relay Protocol (CRP). CRP header fields carry AI-specific metadata â€” context quality, safety risk, provenance integrity, regulatory classification, agent state, and memory layer information â€” as standard HTTP header fields on AI request/response cycles. This specification provides normative definitions for 58 header fields across six namespaces, suitable for provisional registration in the IANA HTTP Field Name Registry.

---

## Status of This Document

This is a working draft. It is intended for submission as an IETF Internet-Draft (`draft-vidiniotis-crp-headers-00`). The header field definitions herein are also the basis for IANA provisional registration requests.

All CRP header fields use the `CRP-` prefix. This document requests reservation of the `CRP-` prefix and registration of all named header fields in the IANA HTTP Field Name Registry.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

HTTP became the universal substrate for networked applications in part because its header mechanism provided a standardised, extensible metadata contract readable by any participant in a request/response chain â€” clients, servers, proxies, CDNs, WAFs â€” without parsing message bodies. Cache-Control made web-scale caching possible. Content-Security-Policy made transport-layer browser security possible. Both operate on the principle that metadata declared in headers is more interoperable than metadata embedded in payloads.

AI inference calls â€” requests to large language models â€” currently carry no standardised metadata about the quality, safety, or governance status of their responses. Every application operator instruments this separately, producing non-interoperable, non-verifiable, non-portable safety signals.

CRP header fields apply the HTTP lesson to AI: standardised metadata in headers, readable by any participant in the AI call chain, without parsing inference payloads.

### 1.2 Scope

This document defines the normative semantics, syntax, allowed values, directionality, and interaction rules for all CRP header fields. It does not define:

- The CRP gateway implementation (see CRP-SPEC-001)
- The Decision Provenance Engine that populates safety headers (see CRP-SPEC-005)
- The envelope packing algorithm that populates context headers (see CRP-SPEC-003)
- The Safety Policy directive language carried in `CRP-Safety-Policy` (see CRP-SPEC-006)
- The session token structure carried in `CRP-Set-Session` (see CRP-SPEC-007)

### 1.3 Relationship to HTTP

CRP header fields are standard HTTP header fields as defined in RFC 9110. They MUST be transmitted as HTTP header fields in the normal HTTP header section. They MUST NOT be placed in HTTP trailers unless explicitly noted.

CRP header fields are distinct from the inference payload (request body and response body). Per Axiom 4 of CRP-SPEC-001, CRP header fields MUST be stripped by the CRP gateway before forwarding requests to LLM providers.

---

## 2. Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

### 2.1 Directionality Notation

- **REQ** â€” Header is sent in the HTTP *request* (client â†’ gateway)
- **RES** â€” Header is sent in the HTTP *response* (gateway â†’ client)
- **BOTH** â€” Header appears in both request and response (semantics may differ)

### 2.2 Value Notation

Header value syntax is described using ABNF [RFC5234]. The following base rules apply:

```abnf
crp-token     = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "." )
crp-hash      = "sha256:" 64HEXDIG
crp-float     = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
crp-fraction  = crp-float  ; constrained to 0.0 â€“ 1.0
crp-uri       = <URI as defined in RFC 3986>
crp-iso8601   = <date-time as defined in ISO 8601>
crp-version   = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
```

### 2.3 Default Behaviour

Unless stated otherwise:
- Missing optional request headers indicate client preference defers to gateway defaults
- Missing response headers indicate the gateway did not compute the value for this call
- Header values are case-insensitive unless stated otherwise

---

## 3. Header Field Design Principles

CRP header fields follow these design principles, derived from existing HTTP header best practices:

**3.1 One signal, one header.** Each header carries a single, clearly defined signal. Composite values (e.g., `CRP-Safety-Distortions: NUMBER_CHANGED:2, NEGATION_FLIP:1`) use structured syntax where multiple values must be carried.

**3.2 Machine-readable values.** All values are designed for programmatic parsing by middleware, WAFs, and logging systems â€” not just human reading. Enum values use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Numeric values use decimal notation.

**3.3 Gateway-generated response headers are authoritative.** Response headers emitted by the CRP gateway are computed from live protocol data. They MUST NOT be set by clients and MUST NOT reflect LLM output. The gateway is the sole authoritative source for all `CRP-Safety-*`, `CRP-Provenance-*`, and `CRP-Compliance-*` response headers.

**3.4 Request headers express client preferences, not mandates.** `CRP-Accept-*` and `CRP-Safety-Policy` headers declare what the client wants. The gateway SHOULD honour them; where it cannot (e.g., CKF has no relevant facts), it MUST document the deviation in the corresponding response header.

**3.5 Progressive adoption.** Applications that ignore CRP response headers receive no harm â€” headers carry metadata, not payload. Applications that read and gate on CRP headers gain safety and governance capability.

---

## 4. Namespace: CRP-Context-*

Context headers carry the state of the Context Envelope and CKF interaction for the current call. They are the AI equivalent of HTTP content negotiation and cache-control headers.

---

### 4.1 CRP-Context-Quality-Tier

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED  
**Stability:** Stable

**Definition:** The quality classification of the Context Envelope assembled for this call, computed by the 3-phase envelope packing algorithm (see CRP-SPEC-003). Quality tier reflects the coverage, saturation, and relevance score of facts included in the envelope.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Quality-Tier = "S" / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D"
```

**Values:**

| Value | Meaning | Saturation Range | Use |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| `S` | Superior â€” all critical facts included, optimal relevance | â‰¥ 0.99 | High-stakes decisions |
| `A` | High â€” comprehensive coverage with minor gaps | â‰¥ 0.95 | Standard production |
| `B` | Adequate â€” majority of relevant facts included | â‰¥ 0.85 | Acceptable for most uses |
| `C` | Marginal â€” significant gaps in relevant coverage | â‰¥ 0.70 | Use with caution |
| `D` | Deficient â€” critical facts missing or insufficient context | < 0.70 | Remediation required |

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Quality-Tier: A
```

**Interaction:** Clients MAY set `CRP-Accept-Quality` to declare minimum acceptable tier. Gateway MUST retry with upgraded strategy or return HTTP 503 if minimum tier cannot be achieved.

---

### 4.2 CRP-Context-Window

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The current window position within the continuation chain, expressed as `current/total`. `total` is the configured maximum window depth for this session (see CRP-SPEC-004 for window continuation specification).

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Window = 1*DIGIT "/" 1*DIGIT
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Window: 3/5
```

**Notes:** When `current` equals `total`, the session has reached maximum continuation depth. The client MUST begin a new session or invoke `dispatch_hierarchical()` to continue.

---

### 4.3 CRP-Context-Saturation

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The ratio of token budget consumed by the Context Envelope relative to the total available context window, expressed as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0. A saturation of 1.0 indicates the envelope has consumed the full available context window.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Saturation = crp-fraction
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Saturation: 0.994
```

**Notes:** Values above 0.98 indicate context pressure. Clients receiving high saturation values SHOULD consider using a smaller query scope, enabling CKF caching, or upgrading to a longer-context model tier.

---

### 4.4 CRP-Context-Facts-Used

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** The number of discrete facts retrieved from the CKF and included in the envelope, expressed as `included/available`. `available` is the total number of candidate facts identified before relevance filtering.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Facts-Used = 1*DIGIT "/" 1*DIGIT
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Facts-Used: 47/312
```

---

### 4.5 CRP-Context-Tokens-Used

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** The number of tokens consumed by the Context Envelope in the LLM's context window, as an integer.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Tokens-Used = 1*DIGIT
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Tokens-Used: 105816
```

---

### 4.6 CRP-Context-Strategy

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The dispatch strategy employed for this call, as selected by the gateway from TaskIntent analysis or from the `CRP-Accept-Strategy` request header.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Strategy = "push" / "pull" / "reflexive" / "agentic" /
                        "hierarchical" / "batch" / "streaming" /
                        "fan-out" / "fan-in"
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Strategy: reflexive
```

---

### 4.7 CRP-Context-Session-Id

**Direction:** BOTH  
**Required:** REQUIRED

**Definition:** The unique identifier for the current CRP session. In requests, used as a hint when a `CRP-Session-Token` is not available. In responses, confirms the session to which this call belongs.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Session-Id = "crp_sess_" 16*32( ALPHA / DIGIT )
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Session-Id: crp_sess_7f3a9bc2d4e1f083
```

---

### 4.8 CRP-Context-ETag

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED  
**Stability:** Stable â€” **NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** A hash of the current CKF fact-set state used to generate this call's Context Envelope. Analogous to HTTP `ETag`. Enables conditional dispatch: clients presenting this value in `CRP-Context-If-Match` on subsequent calls with the same knowledge domain will receive HTTP 304 if the fact-set has not changed, avoiding redundant envelope reconstruction.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-ETag = crp-hash
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-ETag: sha256:4fa8e921abcd1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234
```

**Interaction:** See `CRP-Context-If-Match` and `CRP-Context-Cache` for the full conditional dispatch mechanism.

---

### 4.9 CRP-Context-If-Match

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** Conditional dispatch request. If the presented ETag matches the current CKF fact-set hash, the gateway returns HTTP 304 (Context Not Modified) and skips envelope reconstruction. Analogous to HTTP `If-None-Match`.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-If-Match = crp-hash / "*"
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-If-Match: sha256:4fa8e921abcd1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234
```

**HTTP 304 response:** When the gateway returns 304, the response body is empty. All CRP response headers from the previous matching call MUST be re-emitted with their unchanged values.

---

### 4.10 CRP-Context-Cache

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** Directives controlling CKF read/write behaviour for this call. Analogous to HTTP `Cache-Control`. Multiple directives are separated by commas.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Cache     = cache-directive *( OWS "," OWS cache-directive )
cache-directive       = "no-store" / "no-cache" / "reuse-ckf" /
                        "only-if-ckf" / ( "max-age" "=" delta-seconds )
delta-seconds         = 1*DIGIT
```

**Directive definitions:**

| Directive | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `no-store` | Do not persist this session's facts to the CKF graph. Envelope built from temporary context only. Use for sensitive or PII-containing sessions. |
| `no-cache` | Do not reuse cached envelope. Force full 3-phase reconstruction even if ETag matches. Use when freshness is critical. |
| `reuse-ckf` | Read from CKF but do not trigger re-ingestion of source documents. Use when knowledge base is known to be current. |
| `only-if-ckf` | Refuse dispatch if CKF contains no relevant facts for this query. Returns HTTP 424 (Failed Dependency) if CKF miss. |
| `max-age=N` | Facts retrieved from CKF are considered valid for N seconds. Gateway checks `CRP-Memory-Knowledge-Age` against this value. |

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Cache: reuse-ckf, max-age=3600
```

**GDPR note:** `no-store` MUST be set for sessions processing personal data under GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) (data minimisation) unless CKF persistence has been explicitly authorised in the applicable DPA.

---

### 4.11 CRP-Context-Cache-Status

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** Reports whether the envelope was served from CKF cache or freshly constructed.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Cache-Status = ( "HIT" / "MISS" / "PARTIAL" )
                            [ "; reason=" crp-token ]
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Cache-Status: MISS; reason=facts-updated
CRP-Context-Cache-Status: HIT
CRP-Context-Cache-Status: PARTIAL; reason=partial-ckf-coverage
```

---

### 4.12 CRP-Context-Continuation-Id

**Direction:** BOTH  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** An opaque token referencing the continuation point in the Window DAG. When included in a request, the gateway resumes the session from the referenced window. When included in a response, it provides the continuation pointer for the next call. See CRP-SPEC-004 for the full Window DAG specification.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Continuation-Id = "crp_cont_" 16*32( ALPHA / DIGIT )
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Continuation-Id: crp_cont_9a2fb3c1d4e5f607
```

---

### 4.13 CRP-Accept-Quality

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** Client-declared minimum acceptable quality tier. The gateway MUST NOT return a response with a quality tier lower than declared. If the minimum tier cannot be achieved, the gateway MUST return HTTP 503 with a `CRP-Context-Quality-Tier` header indicating the maximum achievable tier.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Accept-Quality = quality-tier *( OWS "," OWS quality-tier )
quality-tier       = "S" / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D"
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Accept-Quality: S, A
```

---

### 4.14 CRP-Accept-Strategy

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** Client-declared preferred dispatch strategies in order of preference. The gateway uses the first strategy from the list that is applicable to the current TaskIntent. If no listed strategy is applicable, the gateway falls back to automatic strategy selection and MUST report the selected strategy in `CRP-Context-Strategy`.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Accept-Strategy = strategy-token *( OWS "," OWS strategy-token )
strategy-token      = "push" / "pull" / "reflexive" / "agentic" /
                      "hierarchical" / "batch" / "streaming" /
                      "fan-out" / "fan-in"
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Accept-Strategy: reflexive, push
```

---

### 4.15 CRP-Context-Protocol-Version

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** REQUIRED

**Definition:** The CRP protocol version used to process this call.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Context-Protocol-Version = crp-version
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Context-Protocol-Version: 3.0.0
```

---

## 5. Namespace: CRP-Safety-*

Safety headers carry the output of the Decision Provenance Engine (DPE) for the current response. They are response-only by default (generated by the gateway); safety policy and preferences are expressed in `CRP-Safety-Policy` (see CRP-SPEC-006) and `CRP-Accept-Risk` request headers.

**Security note:** All `CRP-Safety-*` response headers are gateway-generated. Clients MUST NOT set `CRP-Safety-*` response headers in requests. Gateways MUST reject requests where `CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Risk`, `CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Score`, or `CRP-Safety-Attribution` appear as request headers.

---

### 5.1 CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Risk

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** REQUIRED (for CRP-Standard and CRP-Full conformance)

**Definition:** The composite hallucination risk classification for the LLM response, computed by the DPE from four weighted signals: attribution (0.35), fidelity (0.25), entailment (0.25), and specificity (0.15). See CRP-SPEC-005 for the complete scoring algorithm. Regulatory amplifiers are applied before classification (see CRP-SPEC-005 Â§4.3).

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Risk = "CRITICAL" / "HIGH" / "MEDIUM" / "LOW"
```

**Classification thresholds (post-amplification composite score):**

| Value | Score Range | Protocol Action | Regulatory Mapping |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `CRITICAL` | â‰¥ 0.70 | HTTP 451 if `halt-on CRITICAL` policy set | EU AI Act Art. 14 (halt) |
| `HIGH` | â‰¥ 0.45 | Strategy upgrade if `upgrade-on-risk` set | EU AI Act Art. 13 (warn) |
| `MEDIUM` | â‰¥ 0.20 | Pass with headers | EU AI Act Art. 52 |
| `LOW` | < 0.20 | Pass | Compliant |

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Risk: LOW
```

---

### 5.2 CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Score

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The raw composite hallucination risk score from the DPE before classification, expressed as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0. Higher values indicate greater hallucination risk.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Score = crp-fraction
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Score: 0.14
```

---

### 5.3 CRP-Safety-Attribution

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The dominant attribution type of claims in the response, computed by DPE Stage 2.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Attribution = "CONTEXT_GROUNDED" / "PARAMETRIC" / "MIXED" / "UNVERIFIABLE"
```

**Values:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `CONTEXT_GROUNDED` | Majority of claims verifiably supported by Context Envelope content |
| `PARAMETRIC` | Majority of claims drawn from LLM parametric memory, not envelope |
| `MIXED` | Significant presence of both context-grounded and parametric claims |
| `UNVERIFIABLE` | Claims cannot be attributed to any verifiable source |

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Attribution: CONTEXT_GROUNDED
```

---

### 5.4 CRP-Safety-Grounding-Pct

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The percentage of factual claims in the response that are verifiably supported by content in the Context Envelope, as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Grounding-Pct = crp-fraction
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Grounding-Pct: 0.923
```

---

### 5.5 CRP-Safety-Fabrications

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The count of fabricated entities detected by DPE Stage 3. A fabricated entity is a named entity (person, organisation, date, statistic, citation) that appears in the response but has no verifiable basis in the Context Envelope or any grounded source.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Fabrications = 1*DIGIT
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Fabrications: 0
```

**Note:** A value of `0` is the expected result for well-grounded responses. Any non-zero value MUST be reported to `CRP-Safety-Report-URI` if configured.

---

### 5.6 CRP-Safety-Distortions

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The count of detected fidelity distortions in the response, where the response has misrepresented content that exists in the Context Envelope. Distortion types are reported as a structured list.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Distortions = distortion-count [ "; types=" distortion-list ]
distortion-count       = 1*DIGIT
distortion-list        = distortion-type *( "," distortion-type )
distortion-type        = "NUMBER_CHANGED" / "NEGATION_FLIP" / "DATE_SHIFTED" /
                         "ENTITY_SUBSTITUTED" / "MAGNITUDE_ALTERED" / "CONTEXT_STRIPPED"
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Distortions: 1; types=NUMBER_CHANGED
CRP-Safety-Distortions: 0
```

---

### 5.7 CRP-Safety-Contradictions

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** The count of internal contradictions detected in the response â€” instances where the response contradicts itself (intra-window) or contradicts an earlier window in the session (cross-window).

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Contradictions = 1*DIGIT [ "; scope=" ( "intra" / "cross-window" / "both" ) ]
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Contradictions: 0
CRP-Safety-Contradictions: 2; scope=cross-window
```

---

### 5.8 CRP-Safety-Omissions

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** Summary of material omissions detected â€” cases where the envelope contained information critical to a complete answer that the LLM did not include in the response.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Omissions = omission-entry *( OWS "," OWS omission-entry )
omission-entry       = ( "CRITICAL" / "HIGH" / "MEDIUM" ) ":" 1*DIGIT
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Omissions: CRITICAL:0, HIGH:1, MEDIUM:2
```

---

### 5.9 CRP-Safety-Entailment-Score

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** The NLI (Natural Language Inference) cross-encoder entailment score measuring the degree to which the response is logically entailed by the Context Envelope, from 0.0 (contradiction) to 1.0 (full entailment). This is one of the four DPE composite signal inputs (weight: 0.25).

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Entailment-Score = crp-fraction
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Entailment-Score: 0.912
```

---

### 5.10 CRP-Safety-Oversight-Mode

**Direction:** BOTH  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED

**Definition:** In requests, declares the human oversight level required for this session. In responses, confirms the oversight mode applied by the gateway and (if applicable) whether an oversight event was triggered.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Oversight-Mode = "auto" / "human-review" / "halt" / "log-only"
```

**Values:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `auto` | Gateway applies oversight based on Safety Policy and risk level |
| `human-review` | Response is held pending human review for any HIGH or CRITICAL risk |
| `halt` | Response is halted unconditionally for any CRITICAL risk (EU AI Act Art. 14) |
| `log-only` | Risk signals logged and reported but response always passed through |

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Oversight-Mode: auto
```

---

### 5.11 CRP-Safety-Mode

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** The global safety strictness level for the session. Overrides individual Safety Policy directives where they are less restrictive.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Mode = "strict" / "warn" / "permissive"
```

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `strict` | Equivalent to `halt-on CRITICAL; warn-on HIGH; block-ungrounded` |
| `warn` | All risk levels passed; HIGH and CRITICAL emitted in headers and reported |
| `permissive` | Risk signals computed and emitted; no gating applied |

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Mode: strict
```

---

### 5.12 CRP-Safety-Policy

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** A directive string declaring the AI safety policy for this session, analogous to Content-Security-Policy. The full directive grammar is defined in CRP-SPEC-006.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Policy = policy-directive *( ";" OWS policy-directive )
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Policy: default-src context; halt-on CRITICAL; warn-on HIGH; require-grounding 0.75; block-ungrounded; report-uri https://comply.crprotocol.io/reports
```

**Interaction with CRP-Safety-Mode:** If both `CRP-Safety-Mode` and `CRP-Safety-Policy` are set, the more restrictive of the two applies per-directive.

---

### 5.13 CRP-Safety-Report-URI

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** URI to which the gateway MUST POST a JSON violation report when a Safety Policy violation occurs (any `halt-on` trigger, fabrication detected, chain integrity broken). Analogous to CSP `report-uri`.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Safety-Report-URI = crp-uri
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Safety-Report-URI: https://comply.crprotocol.io/reports/my-org
```

**Report format:** The gateway POSTs `Content-Type: application/json` with fields: `session_id`, `window_number`, `violation_type`, `risk_level`, `audit_trail_uri`, `timestamp`.

---

### 5.14 CRP-Accept-Risk

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** Maximum risk level the client is willing to accept for this call. If the computed risk exceeds the declared level, the gateway MUST either retry with upgraded strategy (if `upgrade-on-risk` is set in Safety Policy) or halt and return HTTP 451.

CRP-Agent-Loop-Depth: 2
```

---

### 8.3 CRP-Agent-Safety-Budget

**Direction:** BOTH  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED (for agentic strategies)  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** The remaining safety risk budget for the current agent session, expressed as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0. The budget starts at 1.0 and is decremented by the gateway on each call according to the risk level:

| Risk Level | Default Decrement |
|-----------|------------------|
| `LOW` | 0.00 (no decrement) |
| `MEDIUM` | 0.05 |
| `HIGH` | 0.15 |
| `CRITICAL` | 0.35 |

When the budget reaches â‰¤ 0.10, the gateway MUST upgrade `CRP-Safety-Oversight-Mode` to `human-review` regardless of Safety Policy. When it reaches â‰¤ 0.00, the gateway MUST halt and return HTTP 451.

In requests from orchestrator agents, this header passes the remaining budget down to sub-agents. Sub-agents MUST NOT inflate the budget.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Agent-Safety-Budget = crp-fraction

```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Agent-Revision-Round: 2/3
```

---

## 9. Namespace: CRP-Memory-*

Memory headers expose the state of the four-tier memory hierarchy interaction for the current call. They inform clients which memory tiers were accessed and provide cache-like signals for knowledge freshness.

---

### 9.1 CRP-Memory-Tier-Hit

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** The highest memory tier accessed to serve this call's Context Envelope. Higher tier numbers indicate deeper (slower, more persistent) storage was required.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Memory-Tier-Hit = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3"
```

| Value | Tier | Storage | Latency |
|-------|------|---------|---------|

```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Memory-Knowledge-Age: P3D
CRP-Memory-Knowledge-Age: PT6H
```

## 10. Session State Headers

Session state headers are the CRP equivalent of HTTP cookies â€” they carry signed session state, enabling stateless session relay across language boundaries and gateway instances. Full specification in CRP-SPEC-007.

---

### 10.1 CRP-Set-Session

**Direction:** RES  
**Required:** REQUIRED for first window; RECOMMENDED for subsequent windows

**Definition:** Sets the CRP session token on the client, analogous to HTTP `Set-Cookie`. Carries signed session state including session ID, window number, quality history, safety budget, and HMAC chain tip. The token is signed with HMAC-SHA256 using the session signing key and MUST be validated by the gateway on subsequent requests.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Set-Session = "token=" session-token
                  *( ";" OWS session-attribute )
session-token   = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" / "." / "=" / "-" / "_" )
session-attribute = "Path=" path-value
                  / "Max-Age=" delta-seconds
                  / "Signed"
                  / "SameSite=" ( "Strict" / "Lax" / "None" )

---

### 10.2 CRP-Session-Token

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** RECOMMENDED (when set by prior `CRP-Set-Session`)

**Definition:** The session token received via `CRP-Set-Session`, returned by the client on subsequent requests to resume the session, analogous to HTTP `Cookie`. The gateway validates the token signature and extracts session state without requiring server-side session storage.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-Session-Token = session-token
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-Session-Token: eyJzZXNzaW9uX2lkIjoiY3JwX3Nlc3NfN2YzYSJ9.sha256:sig...
```

---

## 11. LLM Configuration Headers

LLM configuration headers allow the CRP gateway to dynamically adjust LLM inference parameters based on session safety state. These headers are used internally by the gateway â€” clients SHOULD NOT set these directly.

---

### 11.1 CRP-LLM-Temperature

**Direction:** Internal (gateway use)  
**Required:** N/A â€” internal to gateway

**Definition:** The temperature value used for the LLM call, after any safety-driven adjustments. Logged in the audit trail.

---

### 11.2 CRP-LLM-Grounding-Mode

**Direction:** REQ  
**Required:** OPTIONAL

**Definition:** Controls the grounding instruction injected into the LLM system prompt by the gateway.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-LLM-Grounding-Mode = "context-strict" / "context-preferred" / "open"
```

| Value | System Prompt Instruction |
|-------|--------------------------|
| `context-strict` | "Answer only using the provided context. Do not use external knowledge." |
| `context-preferred` | "Prefer the provided context. Indicate when using general knowledge." |
| `open` | No grounding instruction injected. |

**Default:** `context-preferred`

**Example:**
```
CRP-LLM-Grounding-Mode: context-strict
```

---

### 11.3 CRP-LLM-Reproducibility-Seed

**Direction:** REQ / stored in audit trail  
**Required:** OPTIONAL  
**NEW in v3.0**

**Definition:** A numeric seed for deterministic LLM sampling, when the provider supports it. Stored in the HMAC audit chain to enable exact regeneration of any response for audit replay. GDPR Art. 22 requires that automated decisions be explainable and reproducible.

**Syntax:**
```abnf
CRP-LLM-Reproducibility-Seed = 1*DIGIT
```

**Example:**
```
CRP-LLM-Reproducibility-Seed: 42
```

---

## 12. Header Interaction Rules

### 12.1 Safety Policy and Override Headers

When `CRP-Safety-Policy` and `CRP-Safety-Mode` are both present, the **more restrictive** setting applies per-directive:
- `CRP-Safety-Mode: strict` + `CRP-Safety-Policy: warn-on CRITICAL` â†’ `halt-on CRITICAL` (strict wins)
- `CRP-Safety-Mode: permissive` + `CRP-Safety-Policy: halt-on CRITICAL` â†’ `halt-on CRITICAL` (policy wins)

### 12.2 ETag and Cache Interaction

`CRP-Context-If-Match` is only evaluated when `CRP-Context-Cache` does NOT contain `no-cache`. If `no-cache` is set, the gateway MUST bypass ETag validation and reconstruct the envelope unconditionally.

### 12.3 Session Token Priority

When both `CRP-Session-Token` and `CRP-Context-Session-Id` are present, `CRP-Session-Token` takes precedence. The gateway validates the token signature; if valid, the embedded session ID overrides `CRP-Context-Session-Id`.

### 12.4 Agentic Safety Budget Propagation

In multi-agent chains, `CRP-Agent-Safety-Budget` presented in a request from a sub-agent is the budget ceiling for that sub-agent's session. The sub-agent's gateway MUST NOT issue a safety budget higher than the value received. This prevents budget inflation in nested agent calls.

### 12.5 Compliance Headers Require Registered AI System

`CRP-Compliance-EU-AI-Act` classification is only meaningful when the AI system has been registered in the CRP Gateway configuration with a system type, deployment domain, and intended purpose. Unregistered systems MUST receive `CRP-Compliance-EU-AI-Act: UNKNOWN` and a log warning.

---

## 13. Error Semantics

### 13.1 HTTP Status Codes Used by CRP

| Status | Condition | Required Headers |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| `200 OK` | Normal response | All applicable CRP headers |
| `304 Not Modified` | ETag match â€” context not changed | `CRP-Context-ETag` |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed Safety Policy, nonce mismatch | `CRP-Safety-Nonce` |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or expired session token | â€” |
| `424 Failed Dependency` | `only-if-ckf` set but CKF miss | `CRP-Context-Cache-Status: MISS` |
| `451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons` | Safety policy halt â€” CRITICAL risk or UNACCEPTABLE EU AI Act class | `CRP-Safety-Hallucination-Risk`, `CRP-Safety-Retry-After`, `CRP-Compliance-Audit-Trail-URI` |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Minimum quality tier cannot be achieved | `CRP-Context-Quality-Tier` (max achievable) |

### 13.2 HTTP 451 Semantics

HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons, RFC 7725) is used by CRP to indicate a safety or regulatory halt. The body of a 451 response MUST include a JSON object:

```json
{
  "crp_halt_reason": "CRITICAL_HALLUCINATION_RISK | UNACCEPTABLE_EU_AI_ACT | SAFETY_BUDGET_DEPLETED",
  "session_id": "crp_sess_...",
  "audit_trail_uri": "https://comply.crprotocol.io/t/...",
  "oversight_required": true,
  "retry_condition": "oversight-required | <ISO8601 datetime>"
}
```

---

## 14. Security Considerations

### 14.1 Header Injection

Clients MUST NOT set `CRP-Safety-*` (response namespace), `CRP-Provenance-*` (response namespace), or `CRP-Compliance-*` (response namespace) headers in requests. Gateways MUST validate and strip any such headers from client requests before processing.

LLM outputs MUST NOT be parsed for CRP header values. All response headers are injected by the gateway post-response analysis, not derived from response content.

### 14.2 Session Token Security

`CRP-Session-Token` values are cryptographically signed. Forged tokens will fail signature validation. Tokens with expired `expires_at` MUST be rejected with HTTP 401. See CRP-SPEC-015 Â§3.2.

### 14.3 Safety Policy Integrity

The `CRP-Safety-Policy` value MUST be validated for syntactic correctness per the grammar in CRP-SPEC-006 before session initialisation. Policies containing unrecognised directives MUST be rejected, not silently ignored, to prevent policy bypass through unknown directive injection.

### 14.4 HMAC Chain Protection

The HMAC chain key (used to generate `CRP-Provenance-HMAC`) MUST be stored securely and never transmitted in any CRP header. See CRP-SPEC-015 Â§3.1 for the complete HMAC specification.

---

## 15. Privacy Considerations

CRP response headers carry metadata about AI calls and may indirectly reveal information about the content of those calls. Specifically:

- `CRP-Compliance-GDPR-PII: true` reveals that the call contained personal data
- `CRP-Safety-Attribution: PARAMETRIC` may reveal that the request was outside the trained knowledge domain
- `CRP-Memory-CKF-Community` reveals the knowledge domain of the query

Implementors MUST consider the sensitivity of CRP response headers when making them available to browser-based clients. In particular, `CRP-Compliance-GDPR-PII` SHOULD be treated as sensitive and not exposed to JavaScript.

The `CRP-Context-Cache: no-store` directive MUST be used for calls processing personal data to prevent persistence in the CKF. See CRP-SPEC-015 Â§6.

---

## 16. IANA Considerations

### 16.1 HTTP Field Name Registrations

This document requests provisional registration of the following HTTP field names in the IANA HTTP Field Name Registry (per RFC 9110 Â§16.3). All fields share the following properties unless noted:

- **Applicable Protocol:** http
- **Status:** provisional
