## Abstract

This document specifies the Contextual Knowledge Fabric (CKF) â€” CRP's persistent knowledge graph that serves as Tier 3 (cold storage) in the four-tier memory hierarchy. The CKF stores facts as graph-embedded nodes with vector representations, connected by semantic edges, and organised into communities via the Leiden algorithm. It is the long-term memory from which Context Envelopes are assembled, and the persistence layer that enables cross-session knowledge reuse, conditional dispatch via ETag caching, and knowledge staleness tracking.

## 2. Fact Node Schema

Each fact in the CKF is stored as a node with the following fields:

```
FactNode {
  fact_id:             string       // UUID â€” immutable after creation
  content:             string       // The fact text (1â€“2048 tokens max)
  content_hash:        string       // SHA-256 of content (change detection)
  embedding:           float[]      // Vector embedding (model-specific dimensionality)
  source_id:           string       // Reference to originating document in Source Registry
  source_location:     string       // Page number, paragraph, URL fragment
  importance_weight:   float        // 0.0â€“1.0, intrinsic to the fact
  community_label:     string       // Leiden community assignment
  ingested_at:         ISO 8601     // Timestamp of initial ingestion
  modified_at:         ISO 8601     // Timestamp of last modification
  access_count:        integer      // Number of times included in an envelope
  last_accessed_at:    ISO 8601     // Timestamp of most recent envelope inclusion
  ttl:                 ISO 8601 dur // Optional time-to-live (e.g., P90D)
  status:              enum         // ACTIVE | STALE | DELETED | QUARANTINED
  metadata:            map          // Arbitrary key-value pairs
}
```

### 2.1 Fact Size Constraints

- Minimum content length: 10 tokens
- Maximum content length: 2,048 tokens
- Facts exceeding 2,048 tokens MUST be chunked during ingestion (see Â§4)

### 2.2 Fact Status Lifecycle

```
ACTIVE â”€â”€â†’ STALE (ttl expired, manual flag, or source document updated)
ACTIVE â”€â”€â†’ DELETED (source document removed, GDPR erasure request)
ACTIVE â”€â”€â†’ QUARANTINED (flagged by DPE as producing fabrication/distortion)
STALE  â”€â”€â†’ ACTIVE (re-ingested from updated source)
STALE  â”€â”€â†’ DELETED (manual cleanup)
DELETED â”€â”€â†’ (permanent removal from HNSW index after 30 days)
```

Facts with status `STALE` MAY still be retrieved during envelope construction but receive a freshness penalty in the ranking phase (CRP-SPEC-003 Â§6.4). Facts with status `DELETED` or `QUARANTINED` MUST NOT be retrieved.

---

## 3. HNSW Vector Index

### 3.1 Purpose

The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index provides sub-linear approximate nearest-neighbour search over fact embeddings, enabling fast retrieval during envelope construction Phase 1 (CRP-SPEC-003 Â§5).

### 3.2 Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `M` | 16 | Max connections per node per layer |
| `ef_construction` | 200 | Size of dynamic candidate list during construction |
| `ef_search` | 100 | Size of dynamic candidate list during search |
| `distance_metric` | `cosine` | Distance function for similarity |
| `dimensions` | Model-dependent | Embedding vector dimensionality (e.g., 1536 for text-embedding-3-small) |

### 3.3 Index Maintenance

- New facts are added to the index immediately upon ingestion
- Deleted facts are marked in a deletion set and excluded from search results; physical removal occurs during periodic index compaction
- Modified facts (content_hash changed) trigger re-embedding and index update
- Index is rebuilt fully if >20% of nodes have been modified/deleted since last rebuild

### 3.4 Multi-Model Embeddings

If the CRP deployment changes embedding models (e.g., upgrading from text-embedding-3-small to text-embedding-3-large):
- All existing facts MUST be re-embedded with the new model
- The HNSW index MUST be rebuilt
- During migration, dual indexes MAY run in parallel
- The CKF state hash (ETag) changes on embedding model change â€” all client ETags are invalidated

---

## 4. Document Ingestion Pipeline

### 4.1 Ingestion Flow

```
Source Document â†’ Chunking â†’ Fact Extraction â†’ Embedding â†’ HNSW Insert â†’ Community Update
```

### 4.2 Chunking Strategy

Documents are chunked using a semantic-aware chunking strategy:

1. **Paragraph-level splitting:** Split on paragraph boundaries first
2. **Sentence-level refinement:** If a paragraph exceeds 512 tokens, split at sentence boundaries
3. **Overlap:** 10% token overlap between adjacent chunks to preserve cross-boundary context
4. **Metadata preservation:** Each chunk retains: source_id, page number, section heading

### 4.3 Fact Extraction

Each chunk becomes one or more facts:
- Simple chunks (single coherent assertion) â†’ 1 fact
- Complex chunks (multiple assertions) â†’ decomposed into N facts using the claim segmentation model (same as DPE Stage 1, CRP-SPEC-005 Â§3)

### 4.4 Importance Weight Assignment

Importance weight is assigned based on source metadata:

| Source Type | Base Weight | Modifiers |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Regulatory text (laws, standards) | 0.90 | +0.05 for specific articles |
| Official documentation | 0.80 | +0.05 for version-specific content |
| Peer-reviewed research | 0.75 | +0.10 for meta-analyses |
| Internal company documents | 0.70 | Varies by classification |
| Web content | 0.50 | +0.10 for authoritative domains |
| User-provided context | 0.60 | Configurable |

### 4.5 Source Registry

Every ingested document is recorded in the Source Registry:

```
SourceRecord {
  source_id:           string       // UUID
  title:               string       
  uri:                 string       // Original document location
  document_hash:       string       // SHA-256 of document content
  ingested_at:         ISO 8601
  fact_count:          integer      // Number of facts extracted
  status:              enum         // ACTIVE | UPDATED | REMOVED
}
```

When a source document is updated:
1. New version is ingested alongside old version
2. Old facts are marked `STALE`
3. New facts reference the same source_id with updated content_hash
4. DPE is notified of source changes for cross-window coherence validation

---

## 5. Community Detection (Leiden Algorithm)

### 5.1 Purpose

The Leiden algorithm clusters semantically related facts into communities. Communities enable:
- Targeted retrieval expansion (CRP-SPEC-003 Â§5.2 Step 1.3)
- Knowledge domain identification (emitted as `CRP-Memory-CKF-Community`)
- Diversity scoring in the ranking phase

### 5.2 Graph Construction

Before running Leiden, a similarity graph is constructed:
1. For each fact, find K nearest neighbours in the HNSW index (default K=20)
2. Create edges between facts with cosine similarity â‰¥ 0.60
3. Edge weight = cosine similarity value

### 5.3 Leiden Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `resolution` | 1.0 | Controls community granularity (higher = more communities) |
| `n_iterations` | 10 | Optimisation iterations |
| `min_community_size` | 3 | Minimum facts per community |

### 5.4 Community Labels

Each community is assigned a human-readable label by sampling the 5 highest-importance facts and extracting the dominant topic via keyword extraction.

### 5.5 Reclustering Schedule

Communities are recomputed:
- After every ingestion batch of â‰¥50 new facts
- On a scheduled basis (default: weekly)
- When explicitly triggered by the operator
- Reclustering changes the CKF state hash â†’ invalidates all client ETags

---

## 6. CKF State Hash (ETag Source)

### 6.1 Computation

```
state_components = SORT([
  f.fact_id + ":" + f.content_hash + ":" + f.status
  for f in all_active_facts
])
ckf_state_hash = SHA-256("|".join(state_components))
```

### 6.2 Change Detection

The state hash changes when:
- Any fact is added, modified, or deleted
- Any fact's status changes
- Community reclustering occurs (labels change)

It does NOT change when:
- Facts are accessed (read-only)
- Access counts are updated
- No structural changes occur

### 6.3 ETag Emission

The CKF state hash is the source for `CRP-Context-ETag` (CRP-SPEC-002 Â§4.8).

---

## 7. Cache-Control Semantics for CKF

### 7.1 CRP-Context-Cache Directives (CKF-Specific)

| Directive | CKF Behaviour |
|-----------|--------------|
| `reuse-ckf` | Read from CKF but do not trigger source re-ingestion |
| `no-store` | Do not write this session's facts to CKF. Read is still permitted. |
| `no-cache` | Ignore cached envelope; force full Phase 1 retrieval from CKF |
| `only-if-ckf` | Fail with 424 if CKF has no facts with relevance â‰¥ 0.50 for this query |
| `max-age=N` | Facts with `ingested_at` older than N seconds are treated as STALE for ranking |

### 7.2 GDPR-Specific Cache Behaviour

When `CRP-Context-Cache: no-store` is set:
- Session-generated facts are held in Tier 1 (hot session cache) only
- On session end, all Tier 1 facts for this session are purged
- No CKF graph mutations occur
- The CKF state hash does not change

When `CRP-Compliance-Data-Residency` is set:
- CKF reads are restricted to facts stored in the specified region
- CKF writes are directed to the specified region's storage

---

## 8. Fact Lifecycle Management

### 8.1 TTL-Based Staleness

Facts with a `ttl` field are automatically marked `STALE` when `current_time > ingested_at + ttl`. Stale facts receive a freshness penalty in ranking but are not deleted.

### 8.2 Access-Based Eviction

Facts not accessed within a configurable period (default: 180 days) MAY be archived to cold storage (reducing HNSW index size). Archived facts can be restored on demand.

### 8.3 GDPR Right to Erasure

When a customer requests erasure (GDPR Art. 17):
1. All facts with the specified `source_id` are marked `DELETED`
2. The HNSW index excludes deleted facts from search results immediately
3. Deleted facts are physically removed from storage within 30 days
4. The CKF state hash is recomputed â†’ all ETags invalidated
5. The audit trail records the erasure event (the fact that erasure occurred is retained; the erased content is not)

### 8.4 Fact Quarantine

If the DPE detects that a specific CKF fact consistently produces fabrications or distortions when included in envelopes (tracked via the audit trail):
1. The fact is marked `QUARANTINED`
2. Quarantined facts are excluded from retrieval
3. The operator is notified to review the source document
4. Quarantine can be lifted manually after review

---

## 9. Multi-Tenant CKF Isolation

### 9.1 Tenant Isolation Model

In multi-tenant CRP Gateway deployments:
- Each tenant has a separate CKF namespace
- HNSW indexes are per-tenant (no cross-tenant vector search)
- Community detection runs per-tenant
- CKF state hashes are per-tenant
- Cross-tenant fact access is architecturally impossible

### 9.2 Shared Knowledge Bases

Operators MAY configure shared CKF namespaces accessible by multiple tenants (e.g., regulatory knowledge). Shared namespaces:
- Are read-only for tenants
- Are managed by the platform operator
- Have their own state hash (included in the combined ETag computation)
